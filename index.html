      <h2>Welcome to BroodGuard</h2>
      <p><strong>BroodGuard</strong> is a youth-led agro-technology startup that combines biology, agriculture, and innovation to solve real poultry challenges on small and medium-scale farms. We design farm-ready solutions to reduce chick mortality, improve feeding accuracy, and monitor bird behavior — all without expensive equipment.</p>

      <p>As a team driven by local experience and science, we’re focused on helping farmers grow stronger flocks while saving money, time, and effort. Whether it's through smart separation strategies, natural feed supplements, or farm management tools, we bring practical answers to the coop.</p>

      <h2>Why BroodGuard Was Created</h2>
      <p>BroodGuard was born after observing serious problems in poultry — chicks dying from stress, poor feeding systems, and overcrowding. During one of my earliest flocks of 100 birds, I noticed that separating chickens where they could hear but not see each other led to strange behaviors and poor feeding. That experience sparked experiments and gave birth to this idea: what if technology could guard the growth process?</p>

      <p>So, we built BroodGuard — to protect chicks, support farmers, and guide agricultural change.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a Nigeria where agriculture is smart, sustainable, and youth-led. We want to empower rural and urban farmers with tools that work — not just in labs, but in real farms with real problems.</p>

      <p><strong>BroodGuard isn’t just about poultry — it's about proving that young people can lead solutions that feed our future.</strong></p>
